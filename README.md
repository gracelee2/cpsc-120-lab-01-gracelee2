# CPSC 120 - Lab 01

# Instructions

Write a program for each exercise sub-directory. Each exercise subdirectory is prefixed with the string `part-`. The subdirectory contains a README.md which explains the requirements for the exercise.

Every file that you submit must have a header. Please follow the [guidelines provided for this course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17WkDlxO92zpb26pYM1NIACPcMWtCOlKO7WCrWC6YxRo/edit?usp=sharing).

Please adhere to the [Google C++ coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

When writing git log comments, please make them descriptive and meaningful.

# Rubric
Each exercise is worth 5 points. There is a total of 15 points possible. Your program must compile before it is graded. Submissions that do not compile shall be assigned a zero grade.

For each problem:

* Functionality (3 points): Your submission shall be assessed for the appropriate constructs and strategies to address the exercise. A program the passes the instructor's tests completely receives full marks. A program that partially passes the instructors tests receives partial-marks. A program that fails the majority or all the tests receives no marks.

* Format & Readability (2 point): Your submission shall be assessed by checking whether your code passess the style and format check, as well as how well it follows the proper naming conventions, and internal documentation guidelines. Git log messages are an integral part of how readable your project is. Failure to include a header forfeits all marks.
